When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is handy when you have to collaborate on the same repository. Also it could act as a
backup. If Github is reliable, that is.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
An automatic pull might interfere with commits you're making locally.
