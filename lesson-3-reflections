When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It is handy when you have to collaborate on the same repository. Also it could act as a
backup. If Github is reliable, that is.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
An automatic pull might interfere with commits you're making locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?
Forks are clones of a repository within Github. Clone is either a local clone of a local
repository or a local clone from a remote repository. A branche is a new separate line
of commits from the master branch within one repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
When you're offline you are up-to-date enough to work on the changes. You can still
make your changes without the fear you are too much behind with your branch.
