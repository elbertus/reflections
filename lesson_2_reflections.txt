What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a meta data folder (.git). You need that folder in order for
git to store the commits you will make.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
I have no clue. Usually youput files in a staging area to have a
snapshot which is fixed before sending to an end destination.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?
You can see what is in the staging area itself and you can see the
difference between the most recent commit and the staging area. If there
are more than one logical changes, you can spot this now.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?
Sometimes you want experiment ona feature without touching the master
branche. And sometimes you want to make a different version of the
application, f.i. a different language. With a branch you can create a
different development version of your product.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Diagrams help you to see which branches are in existance and where they
have branched of from the master.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent
it in the diagram the way we do?

are weaved into the first one base on date time of the commit.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing
merges manually?
With automatic merge you get every possible conflict, git won't overlook
anything. But you can end up with a long list of conflicts and code to
resolve. With manual merging you can only pick those pieces of code from
both files you need and resolve conflicts along the way. This looks 
cleaner but you run the risk of missing conflicts.
