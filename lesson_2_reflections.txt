What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a meta data folder (.git). You need that folder in order for
git to store the commits you will make.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
I have no clue. Usually youput files in a staging area to have a
snapshot which is fixed before sending to an end destination.
